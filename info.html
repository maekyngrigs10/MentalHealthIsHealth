                            <p>Depression is a persistent feeling of sadness or loss of interest in activities you would normally enjoy. Most of the time medical professionals will ask the question, “Have these feelings been going on for longer than two weeks?” They ask this because if this feeling lasts longer than two weeks, it might be depression. 2.7 million kids ages 3-17 have diagnosed depression, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. These numbers were taken in 2016-2019, pre-covid.</p>

                            <p style="padding-left:3em;padding-right:5em;float: left;">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  is commonly known as ADHD. ADHD is a developmental disorder which can follow a child into adult years. Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity are the three main issues of ADHD. Inattention is the struggle to maintain focus. Not listening closely to small details, or not following through with tasks that require lots of mental effort are both some examples of inattention. Some examples of hyperactivity and impulsivity are fidgeting, talking excessively, and interrupting others. ADHD can make everyday tasks very difficult which is why it is important to seek help if you are struggling with symptoms. </p>

                            <p>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is commonly known as OCD. OCD is characterized by unwanted intrusive thoughts that interrupt daily life.

Some examples of compulsions are having to clean things a certain way, rewrite, reread or re-talk, or avoid certain words or numbers due to a negative connotation the person puts upon them. OCD can be very hard to live with due to these compulsions, this is why talking to someone trusted is always a good idea. </p>
