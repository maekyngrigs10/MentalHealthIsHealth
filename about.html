                            <p>I am a highschool junior at Southern Indiana Career and Technical Center. Mental health is something I personally have struggled with. Over the last couple of years, I’ve dealt with the rollercoasters of depression, anxiety, and body image issues. It’s never easy. It’s hard and ever changing. I’ve dealt with people who dismiss the hardships of mental health, most of the time people just do not understand mental illness. This is why mental health education is so important.

                            <p>I am a junior at Castle High School. I discovered my love for promoting mental health awareness around last year when I was struggling. I was having a hard time with anxiety and one of my biggest questions I had was “what is too much worrying?” I just had no idea what to do, where to go, or how to talk about it. My goal with this project is to destigmatize, bring awareness to, and to help people manage their mental health.</p>

                            <p >I am a part of the Health Science program at the Southern Indiana Career and Technical Center, and I’m a junior at New Tech Institute. I’ve never really really educated myself on what mental health is. My thought on it was that mental health wasn’t  that serious, until not long ago I experienced a traumatic event, which led to me to struggle very much with my own mental health. I never really knew what to do or how to get the proper help I needed. With this project, I hope to have not only educated myself on how important mental health is, but to have also reached out to other people about how serious mental health is.  </p>
